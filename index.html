  <h2 id= "programmer">Programmer in the making</h2>
  <p>I am learning to code at Le Wagon coding bootcamp and will soon be starting
  my career in digital consulting. Before Le Wagon, I studied economics, geography
  and management in the UK and particularly enjoyed researching how new technologies
  can change many industries. I love travelling üåç, coding üñ• and rowing üö£‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è </p>

  <h2>Travelling</h2>
  <p>I have had an extremelly international upbringing, having lived in France,
   the UK and Bahrain. Therefore, I have come to love discovering new places and
   cultures. Among the countries I visited, my personal favourites are: Jordan,
   Oman, Myanmar, India and the US West Coast!

  <h2>Coding </h2>
  <p>I never thought I would become a coder. However, I realised throughout my degree
  and internships that coding is an essential skill to have in today's digital age. Le
  Wagon introduced me to the tech environment, which I came to love ü§ì!

  <h2>Rowing</h2>
  <p>I picked up rowing during my year in Cambridge and I fell in love with the sport!
  Rowing not only gave me discipline, but also tought me how to challenge myself and work
  as a team. Whilst the early mornings were tough, the bump races were messy and the ergs were
  painful, the experience was incredible!</p>
